# House_price_prediction_using_machine_leaning
In this project, I have tried to implement Linear Regession to predict prices of houses. 
This repository contains code and resources for a simple house price prediction model using Linear Regression. 
The goal of this project is to predict the selling price of houses based on various features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, basement, guestroom and more.
